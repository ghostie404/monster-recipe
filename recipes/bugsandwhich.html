    <p>A crunchy, protein-packed favorite among trolls, goblins, and forest-dwelling fiends. This sandwich is piled high with sizzling insects, wriggling condiments, and earthy toppings straight from the underbrush. Great for midday munching or late-night lurking. Best served on toasted fungus bread with a side of slime chips.</p>
